 <H1>Background</H1>
<P> I graduated from UT Austin with a degree in computer science in 2019. I currently work as a software engineer. My expanded interests within software engineering include: reverse engineering, infrastructure as code in devops, front end development, and REST api development. My favorite aspects of software engineering in general are problem solving and debugging. My hobbies include journaling, sewing, crocheting, and reading.
